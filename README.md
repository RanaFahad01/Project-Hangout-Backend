# Project Hangout: The Backend API

Project Hangout is a project inspired by the lack of social life every college student has felt at some point in their lives.

It lets users post activities (gaming, studying, hangouts etc) along with their contact information. Other users can then view these activities and contact the poster if interested.

### Features
* **Easy To Use** — All you'll have to do to use it is visit the website! No installations needed
* **Simple authentication process** — No need to log in for viewing posts, only for making posts.
* **Moderated content** — All posts are monitored to check for inappropriate content, ensuring a friendly and welcoming space!

## (COMING SOON) Getting Started (As a User)

I will post instructions here on how to use the service once I'm done creating the frontend for the API. Thank you for your patience!

See [Getting Started (As a Developer)](#getting-started-as-a-developer) for instructions on how to get a copy up and running for development and testing purposes.
